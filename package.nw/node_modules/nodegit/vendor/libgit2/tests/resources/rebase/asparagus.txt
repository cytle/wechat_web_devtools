ASPARAGUS SOUP.

TAKE FOUR LARGE BUNCHES of asparagus, scrape it nicely, cut off one inch
OF THE TOPS, and lay them in water, chop the stalks and put them on the
FIRE WITH A PIECE OF BACON, a large onion cut up, and pepper and salt;
ADD TWO QUARTS OF WATER, boil them till the stalks are quite soft, then
PULP THEM THROUGH A SIEVE, and strain the water to it, which must be put
back in the pot; put into it a chicken cut up, with the tops of
asparagus which had been laid by, boil it until these last articles are
sufficiently done, thicken with flour, butter and milk, and serve it up.
