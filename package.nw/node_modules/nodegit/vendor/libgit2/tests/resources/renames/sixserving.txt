I  KEEP  six  honest  serving-men
  (They  taught  me  all  I  knew);
Their  names  are  What  and  Why  and  When
  And  How  and  Where  and  Who.
I  send  them  over  land  and  sea,
  I  send  them  east  and  west;
But  after  they  have  worked  for  me,
  I  give  them  all  a  rest.

I  let  them  rest  from  nine  till  five,
  For  I  am  busy  then,
As  well  as  breakfast,  lunch,  and  tea,
  For  they  are  hungry  men.
But  different  folk  have  different  views;
I  know  a  person  small—
She  keeps  ten  million  serving-men,
Who  get  no  rest  at  all!

She  sends'em  abroad  on  her  own  affairs,
  From  the  second  she  opens  her  eyes—
One  million  Hows,  two  million  Wheres,
And  seven  million  Whys!

    --  Rudyard  Kipling
