/**
 * [**libgit2**][lg] is a portable, pure C implementation of the Git core
 * methods provided as a re-entrant linkable library with a solid API,
 * allowing you to write native speed custom Git applications in any
 * language which supports C bindings.
 *
 * This file is an example of using that API in a real, compilable C file.
 * As the API is updated, this file will be updated to demonstrate the new
 * functionality.
 *
 * If you're trying to write something in C using [libgit2][lg], you should
 * also check out the generated [API documentation][ap]. We try to link to
 * the relevant sections of the API docs in each section in this file.
 *
 * **libgit2** (for the most part) only implements the core plumbing
 * functions, not really the higher level porcelain stuff. For a primer on
 * Git Internals that you will need to know to work with Git at this level,
 * check out [Chapter 10][pg] of the Pro Git book.
