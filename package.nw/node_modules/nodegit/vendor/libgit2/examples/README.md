libgit2 examples
================

These examples are a mixture of basic emulation of core Git command line
functions and simple snippets demonstrating libgit2 API usage (for use
with Docurium).  As a whole, they are not vetted carefully for bugs, error
handling, and cross-platform compatibility in the same manner as the rest
of the code in libgit2, so copy with caution.

That being said, you are welcome to copy code from these examples as
desired when using libgit2. They have been [released to the public domain][cc0],
so there are no restrictions on their use.
