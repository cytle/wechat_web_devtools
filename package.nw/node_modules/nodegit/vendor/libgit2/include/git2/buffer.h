/**
 * A data buffer for exporting data from libgit2
 *
 * Sometimes libgit2 wants to return an allocated data buffer to the
 * caller and have the caller take responsibility for freeing that memory.
 * This can be awkward if the caller does not have easy access to the same
 * allocation functions that libgit2 is using.  In those cases, libgit2
 * will fill in a `git_buf` and the caller can use `git_buf_free()` to
 * release it when they are done.
 *
 * A `git_buf` may also be used for the caller to pass in a reference to
 * a block of memory they hold.  In this case, libgit2 will not resize or
 * free the memory, but will read from it as needed.
 *
 * A `git_buf` is a public structure with three fields:
 *
 * - `ptr` points to the start of the allocated memory.  If it is NULL,
 *   then the `git_buf` is considered empty and libgit2 will feel free
 *   to overwrite it with new data.
 *
 * - `size` holds the size (in bytes) of the data that is actually used.
 *
 * - `asize` holds the known total amount of allocated memory if the `ptr`
 *    was allocated by libgit2.  It may be larger than `size`.  If `ptr`
 *    was not allocated by libgit2 and should not be resized and/or freed,
 *    then `asize` will be set to zero.
 *
 * Some APIs may occasionally do something slightly unusual with a buffer,
 * such as setting `ptr` to a value that was passed in by the user.  In
 * those cases, the behavior will be clearly documented by the API.

 * allocated block of data.  Be careful so that memory allocated by the
 * caller is not lost.  As a special variant, if you pass `target_size` as
 * 0 and the memory is not allocated by libgit2, this will allocate a new
 * buffer of size `size` and copy the external data into it.
 *
 * Currently, this will never shrink a buffer, only expand it.
 *
 * If the allocation fails, this will return an error and the buffer will be
 * marked as invalid for future operations, invaliding the contents.
