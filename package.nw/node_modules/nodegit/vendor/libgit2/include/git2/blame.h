 *     git_blame_options opts = GIT_BLAME_OPTIONS_INIT;
 *
 * - `flags` is a combination of the `git_blame_flag_t` values above.
 * - `min_match_characters` is the lower bound on the number of alphanumeric
 *   characters that must be detected as moving/copying within a file for it to
 *   associate those lines with the parent commit. The default value is 20.
 *   This value only takes effect if any of the `GIT_BLAME_TRACK_COPIES_*`
 *   flags are specified.
 * - `newest_commit` is the id of the newest commit to consider.  The default
 *                   is HEAD.
 * - `oldest_commit` is the id of the oldest commit to consider.  The default
 *                   is the first commit encountered with a NULL parent.
 *	- `min_line` is the first line in the file to blame.  The default is 1 (line
 *	             numbers start with 1).
 *	- `max_line` is the last line in the file to blame.  The default is the last
 *	             line of the file.
