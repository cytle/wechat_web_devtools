# This function splits the sources files up into their appropriate
# subdirectories.  This is especially useful for IDEs like Xcode and
# Visual Studio, so that you can navigate into the libgit2_clar project,
# and see the folders within the tests folder (instead of just seeing all
# source and tests in a single folder.)
