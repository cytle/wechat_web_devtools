/*
 * Conventional binary search loop looks like this:
 *
 *	unsigned lo, hi;
 *		do {
 *				unsigned mi = (lo + hi) / 2;
 *				int cmp = "entry pointed at by mi" minus "target";
 *				if (!cmp)
 *						return (mi is the wanted one)
 *				if (cmp > 0)
 *						hi = mi; "mi is larger than target"
 *				else
 *						lo = mi+1; "mi is smaller than target"
 *		} while (lo < hi);
 *
 * The invariants are:
 *
 * - When entering the loop, lo points at a slot that is never
 *	above the target (it could be at the target), hi points at a
 *	slot that is guaranteed to be above the target (it can never
 *	be at the target).
 *
 * - We find a point 'mi' between lo and hi (mi could be the same
 *	as lo, but never can be as same as hi), and check if it hits
 *	the target. There are three cases:
 *
 *	- if it is a hit, we are happy.
 *
 *	- if it is strictly higher than the target, we set it to hi,
 *		and repeat the search.
 *
 *	- if it is strictly lower than the target, we update lo to
 *		one slot after it, because we allow lo to be at the target.
 *
 *	If the loop exits, there is no matching entry.
 *
 * When choosing 'mi', we do not have to take the "middle" but
 * anywhere in between lo and hi, as long as lo <= mi < hi is
 * satisfied. When we somehow know that the distance between the
 * target and lo is much shorter than the target and hi, we could
 * pick mi that is much closer to lo than the midway.
 *
 * Now, we can take advantage of the fact that SHA-1 is a good hash
 * function, and as long as there are enough entries in the table, we
 * can expect uniform distribution. An entry that begins with for
 * example "deadbeef..." is much likely to appear much later than in
 * the midway of the table. It can reasonably be expected to be near
 * 87% (222/256) from the top of the table.
 *
 * However, we do not want to pick "mi" too precisely. If the entry at
 * the 87% in the above example turns out to be higher than the target
 * we are looking for, we would end up narrowing the search space down
 * only by 13%, instead of 50% we would get if we did a simple binary
 * search. So we would want to hedge our bets by being less aggressive.
 *
 * The table at "table" holds at least "nr" entries of "elem_size"
 * bytes each. Each entry has the SHA-1 key at "key_offset". The
 * table is sorted by the SHA-1 key of the entries. The caller wants
 * to find the entry with "key", and knows that the entry at "lo" is
 * not higher than the entry it is looking for, and that the entry at
 * "hi" is higher than the entry it is looking for.

			 * Either one of these entries is it (and
			 * we do not care which), or we do not have
			 * it.
			 *
			 * Furthermore, we know that one of our

			 *
			 *     idx 0 1 2 3 4 5

			 * (e.g., by first mi=3, then mi=0). But we
			 * can never have lo > 1, because B < C.
			 * That is, if our key is less than the
			 * run, we know that "lo" is the edge, but
			 * we can say nothing of "hi". Similarly,
			 * if our key is greater than the run, we
			 * know that "hi" is the edge, but we can
			 * say nothing of "lo".
			 *
			 * Therefore if we do not find it, we also
			 * know where it would go if it did exist:
			 * just on the far side of the edge that we
