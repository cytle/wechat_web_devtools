## Quick Start

Lightweight collection of 35+ functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system and OS information (Linux, macOS, partial Windows and FreeBSD support) - no npm dependencies.

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install systeminformation --save
```

### Usage

All functions (except `version` and `time`) are implemented as asynchronous functions. Here a small example how to use them:

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

// callback style
si.cpu(function(data) {
	console.log('CPU-Information:');
	console.log(data);
});

// promises style - new in version 3
si.cpu()
	.then(data => console.log(data))
	.catch(error => console.error(error));

// full async / await example (node >= 7.6)
async function cpu() {
  try {
    const data = await si.cpu();
    console.log(data)
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
  }
}
```

## Core concept

[Node.js][nodejs-url] comes with some basic OS information, but I always wanted a little more. So I came up to write this
little library. This library is still work in progress. Version 3 comes with further improvements. First it
requires now node.js version 4.0 and above. Another big change is, that all functions now return promises. You can use them
like before with callbacks OR with promises (see example in this documentation). I am sure, there is for sure room for improvement.
I was only able to test it on several Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu distributions as well as macOS (Mavericks, Yosemite, El Captain, Sierra, High Sierra) and some Windows and FreeBSD machines.
Since version 2 nearly all functionality is available for OS X/Darwin platforms. In Version 3 I started to add windows and (partial) FreeBSD support - see docs.

If you have comments, suggestions & reports, please feel free to contact me!

I also created a nice little command line tool called [mmon][mmon-github-url]  (micro-monitor) for Linux and macOS, also available via [github][mmon-github-url] and [npm][mmon-npm-url]

### cb: Asynchronous Function Calls (callback)

Remember: all functions (except `version` and `time`) are implemented as asynchronous functions! There are now three ways to consume them:

**Callback Style**

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

si.networkStats('eth1', function(data) {
	console.log('Network Interface Stats (eth1):');
	console.log('- is up: ' + data.operstate);
	console.log('- RX bytes overall: ' + data.rx);
	console.log('- TX bytes overall: ' + data.tx);
	console.log('- RX bytes/sec: ' + data.rx_sec);
	console.log('- TX bytes/sec: ' + data.tx_sec);
})
```

### Promises

**Promises Style** is new in version 3.0.

When omitting callback parameter (cb), then you can use all function in a promise oriented way. All functions (exept of `version` and `time`) are returning a promise, that you can consume:

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

si.networkStats('eth1')
	.then(data => {
		console.log('Network Interface Stats (eth1):');
		console.log('- is up: ' + data.operstate);
		console.log('- RX bytes overall: ' + data.rx);
		console.log('- TX bytes overall: ' + data.tx);
		console.log('- RX bytes/sec: ' + data.rx_sec);
		console.log('- TX bytes/sec: ' + data.tx_sec);
	})
	.catch(error => console.error(error));

```

### Async / Await

**Using async / await** (available since node v7.6)

Since node v7.6 you can also use the `async` / `await` pattern. The above example would then look like this:

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

async function network() {
    try {
        const data = await si.networkStats('eth1');
        console.log(`Network Interface Stats (eth1):
        - is up: ${data.operstate}
        - RX bytes overall: ${data.rx}
        - TX bytes overall: ${data.tx}
        - RX bytes/sec: ${data.rx_sec}
        - TX bytes/sec: ${data.tx_sec}`)
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e)
    }
}
```

## Known Issues

#### macOS - Temperature Sensor

To be able to measure temperature on macOS I created a litte additional package. Due to some difficulties
in NPM with `optionalDependencies`  I unfortunately was getting unexpected warnings on other platforms.
So I decided to drop this optional dependencies for macOS - so by default, you will not get correct values.

But if you need to detect macOS temperature just run the following additional
installation command:

```bash
$ npm install osx-temperature-sensor --save
```

`systeminformation` will then detect this additional library and return the temperature when calling systeminformations standard function `cpuTemperature()`

#### Windows Temperature, Battery, ...

`wmic` - which is used to determine temperature and battery sometimes needs to be run with admin
privileges. So if you do not get any values, try to run it again with according
privileges. If you still do not get any values, your system might not support this feature.
In some cases we also discovered that `wmic` returned incorrect temperature values.

#### Linux Temperature

In some cases you need to install the linux `sensors` package to be able to measure temperature
e.g. on DEBIAN based systems by running `sudo apt-get install lm-sensors`

## *: Additional Notes

In `fsStats`, `disksIO` and `networkStats` the `results / sec.` values (rx_sec, IOPS, ...) are calculated correctly beginning
with the second call of the function. It is determined by calculating the difference of transferred bytes / IOs
divided by the time between two calls of the function.

The first time you are calling one of this functions, you will get -1 for transfer rates. The second time, you should then get statistics based on the time between the two calls …

So basically, if you e.g. need a values for network stats every second, your code should look like this:

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

setInterval(function() {
	si.networkStats().then(data => {
	    console.log(data);
	})
}, 1000)
```

Beginning with the second call, you get network transfer values per second.
